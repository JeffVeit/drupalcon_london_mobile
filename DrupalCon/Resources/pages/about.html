    <h2>About this application</h2>
    <p>The DrupalCon mobile application lets you view session schedules,
      descriptions, maps, and presenter biographies from the palm of your hand, as well
      as live updates from the official DrupalCon Twitter feed.  The DrupalCon
      mobile application for iPhone and Android was developed by Kasper Friis Christensen 
      (falkendk) and Jeff Veit of Tanasity, building on the work of Jen Simmons, and 
      Pat Teglia of Palantir.net using the Appcelerator Titanium mobile framework. The code 
      for this application is available at https://github.com/KasperChristensen/drupalcon_london_mobile.</p>
