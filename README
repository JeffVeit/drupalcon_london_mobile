This is the mobile application for DrupalCon London.  It was built using the Appcelerator Titanium mobile framework.

It's based on the DrupalCon Chicago app, made by Larry Garfield (Lead), Pat Teglia (Developer), and Jen Simmons (Designer), all of whom worked for Palantir.net.

It ships with a default copy of the session schedule for DrupalCon London, 22nd-26th August, 2011.  In-app updates are possible for as long as the web site remains dynamic.
